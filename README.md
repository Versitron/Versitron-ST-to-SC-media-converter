## 🔍 What Is an ST-to-SC Media Converter?

An **ST-to-SC media converter** is an optical conversion device that allows network systems using ST fiber connectors (typically older or industrial equipment) to interface with systems using SC connectors (commonly found in modern enterprise networks). It supports both multimode and singlemode fiber applications and ensures optimal signal integrity over extended distances.
